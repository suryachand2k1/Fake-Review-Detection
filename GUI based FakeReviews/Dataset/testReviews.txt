"arrived at 1 30am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel if you party and stay out all night anyway , this hotel would be fine but do n't plan to get any rest if the club is open ! front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while i was checking in she was fine with me and gave me a corner room , but sure would n't want to be on her bad side"
"my stay here was superb the view from my windows was stunning , as i looked out i could see the beautiful grant park the room had a nice airy feel but was also warm and inviting the bed was very comfortable the wireless internet was fast and effective which is nice especially when on business trips the hotel is in walking distance to the museum which is nice for those on vaca overall i thouroughly enjoyed my stay here"
"excellent hotel in the heart of chicago the room we stayed in had a great view of lake michigan we went in july for a vacation and everything is easily accesible from the hotel most major attractions are in around the loop area we also got a great deal on the price i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago its in the right spot for both business and pleasure"
"visiting during a busy 2day conference in chicago most hotels booked solid the full hotel allows you to meet a wide array of customers everyone is complaining about service , cleanliness , and overall experience location is good hotel is tired employees surly too many cool properties to choose from in this town , will never stay here again and will re think hilton in general"
